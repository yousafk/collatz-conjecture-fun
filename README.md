### A fun investigation of the collatz conjecture:
- ```collatz_max_climb.c``` -- Given any positive integer n, display the number of steps required to reach 1 along with the highest number reach while iterating through the sequence
- ```collatz_longest_progression.c``` -- Given any positive integer n, display the positive integer k, where 1 <= k <= n, that has the most number of steps. Display the number of steps for k along with the number milliseconds needed to determine the answer
